**Key Memory Insights:**

- **Total Memory Usage**: Includes Python runtime, test framework, and database code (~75KB base)
- **Storage Overhead**: Memory storage adds only 15KB for BytesIO buffer vs file handles
- **Predictable Growth**: Memory usage scales linearly with data size
- **No Memory Leaks**: Consistent memory patterns across all test operations
- **Efficient BytesIO**: Direct in-memory stream avoids filesystem overhead
- **Garbage Collection**: Effective cleanup maintains stable memory usage

## Technical Implementation

### Memory Storage

- Uses MicroPython's built-in `io.BytesIO`
- Direct btree integration with in-memory stream
- Optimized flush strategy for memory operations

### File Storage

- Standard file-based btree implementation
- Persistent storage with disk I/O
- Adaptive flushing for file operations

### Memory Profiling Methodology

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Used `gc.mem_alloc()` and `gc.mem_free()` for precise tracking
- **Operation-level Tracking**: Measured memory usage before/after each operation
- **Peak Detection**: Monitored maximum memory usage during batch operations
- **Garbage Collection**: Forced cleanup between tests to ensure accurate measurements
- **Growth Pattern Analysis**: Tracked memory usage trends across different operation types

## Recommendations

1. **Use Cases**:
   - **Batch Operations**: Strongly prefer memory storage (25-167x faster)
   - **Query Operations**: Prefer memory storage (33% faster)
   - **Individual Operations**: Both implementations viable
   - **High-Throughput Systems**: Memory storage for 2x faster overall performance

2. **Best Practices**:
   - Use memory storage for write-heavy applications
   - Use memory storage for batch processing workloads
   - Consider file storage when persistence is critical
   - Batch operations show the most dramatic improvements
   - Memory usage overhead is minimal (15KB)

3. **Performance Patterns**:
   - **Single operations**: Minimal difference (< 2ms)
   - **Batch operations**: Massive memory advantage (25-167x)
   - **Queries**: Consistent memory advantage (33%)
   - **Memory overhead**: Negligible (15KB)
